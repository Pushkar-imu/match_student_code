# Example Folder
## Overview
In the `Overview`-chapter you describe the content of this folder, either in text or a listing. For example:

This folder acts as an example for all the future students that will upload their code to this repository. I contains an example ROS-package that only contains a `README`-file to show how a package should be documented. Also any additional Matlab- or Python-script for the analysis of data should be added here.

## Installation
Explain how to install your code. For ROS code, for example, start by explaining that your folder should be copied to catkin_ws/src. If applicable, create a setup.sh file to automate the installation of your code. An example setup.sh can be found [here](https://github.com/match-ROS/match_mobile_robotics/blob/noetic-devel/setup_full.sh).

## Packages
### example_pkg 
Explain in one sentence what the package is. In the package should be another README that deeply explains how to use the package. See the example file in the `example_pkg`-folder for the structure.

## Scripts
### example_script.py 
Explain what the script does and how to use it. Also mention any inputs and outputs.
